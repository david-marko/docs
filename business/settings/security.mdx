## Security

Sarafa prioritizes the security of your business account and financial data. We employ a range of measures to protect your information and ensure a safe and trusted environment. This section outlines some of the key security features and best practices we recommend.

## Changing Your Password
It's a good security practice to update your password periodically. Sarafa makes it easy to change your password whenever you need to.
Here's how you can change your password:

1.  Navigate to `/settings` in your Sarafa dashboard and look for a section labeled "Security" or "Login & Security."
2.  Within the Security settings, you should find an option like "Change Password" or "Update Password." Click on this option.
3.  You will typically be asked to confirm your current password for security reasons. Enter your current password in the designated field.
4.  Next, you will be prompted to enter your **new password**. Choose a strong, unique password that you haven't used before. Remember to include a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols for better security.
5.  You will usually be asked to **confirm your new password** by entering it again in a separate field to ensure you have typed it correctly.
6.  Once you have entered and confirmed your new password, click "Save Changes".
You will likely receive a confirmation message indicating that your password has been successfully changed. The next time you log in to Sarafa, you will need to use your new password.
**Important Security Tips:**

* Do not use the same password for multiple online accounts.
* Avoid using personal information or easily guessable words in your password.
* If you suspect your account has been compromised, change your password immediately and consider enabling Two-Factor Authentication for added security (as described in the [Security](#security) section).
### Email Verification

As part of the account creation and security process, we require you to verify your email address. This helps ensure that the email associated with your account is valid and that you can receive important notifications and account recovery information. 
Always follow the verification steps promptly when creating your account or updating your email address.

### Secure Connections (HTTPS)

All communication between your browser and the Sarafa platform is secured using HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure). This encrypts the data being transmitted, making it unreadable to potential eavesdroppers. You can verify that you are on a secure page by looking for the "https://" prefix in the URL and the padlock icon in your browser's address bar.
### Best Practices for Users

In addition to the security measures implemented by Sarafa, we encourage you to follow these best practices to further protect your account:

* **Keep your devices secure:** Use strong passwords or biometric authentication on your computer and mobile devices. Keep your operating systems and software up to date with the latest security patches.
* **Be cautious of phishing:** Be wary of unsolicited emails, messages, or calls asking for your login credentials or sensitive information. Always verify the sender's authenticity before providing any information.
* **Use a unique email address for Sarafa:** Avoid using an email address that you use for less secure services.
* **Monitor your account activity:** Regularly review your transaction history for any unauthorized transactions. Report any suspicious activity to our support team immediately.
* **Log out when finished:** If you are accessing Sarafa from a public or shared computer, always remember to log out completely when you are finished.

By implementing these security measures and following best practices, we aim to provide you with a secure and reliable platform for managing your business finances. If you have any security concerns or questions, please do not hesitate to contact our support team.
