### Updating Your Business Sector

Specifying your business sector helps Sarafa understand the nature of your operations and may be used for internal analytics and tailored feature recommendations.

1.  Within the Business Settings, locate the "Sector" or "Industry" field.
    {/* <Image src="/images/edit-business-sector-placeholder.png" alt="Edit Business Sector Field" /> */}
2.  Click on the dropdown menu or the edit option.
3.  Select the business sector that best describes your primary activities from the available options.
4.  Click "Save Changes" to update your selection.

### Setting Your Base Currency

Your **Base Currency** is a crucial setting that provides you with a consolidated overview of your financial balances across your various stablecoin wallets. Sarafa will use the prevailing exchange rates to convert the balances in your USD, KES, UGX, and SSP wallets into your chosen base currency, giving you a single, easily understandable figure for your total holdings.

1.  In the Business Settings, find the "Base Currency" field.
    {/* <Image src="/images/edit-base-currency-placeholder.png" alt="Edit Base Currency Field" /> */}
2.  Click on the dropdown menu.
3.  Select your preferred base currency from the available options (e.g., USD, KES, UGX). **Choose the currency in which you primarily want to see your overall financial status.**
4.  Click "Save Changes."

Once you set a base currency, your dashboard and other relevant sections will display your total balance converted into that currency, offering a convenient snapshot of your overall financial position within Sarafa.

### Adding a Business Bio

Your business bio allows you to provide a brief description of your company, its mission, or any other relevant information you want to include in your Sarafa profile. This can be helpful for identification purposes and when interacting with other Sarafa users.

1.  Within the Business Settings, locate the "Bio" or "Description" field.
    {/* <Image src="/images/edit-business-bio-placeholder.png" alt="Edit Business Bio Field" /> */}
2.  Click on the text area or the edit option.
3.  Enter your business bio. Keep it concise and informative.
4.  Click "Save Changes" to save your bio.

### Uploading a Business Logo

Uploading a logo helps personalize your Sarafa account and can be displayed on invoices, payment links, and other customer-facing elements.

1.  In the Business Settings, look for a section related to "Logo" or "Image."
    {/* <Image src="/images/upload-business-logo-placeholder.png" alt="Upload Business Logo Section" /> */}
2.  You should see an option to "Upload Logo" or "Choose File."
3.  Click on this option and select the logo image file from your computer. Ensure the file meets the recommended size and format requirements (if specified).
4.  Once the logo is uploaded, you may have options to preview or adjust it.
5.  Click "Save Changes" to apply your logo to your profile.

By managing these Business Settings, you can tailor your Sarafa experience to better reflect your organization and gain a clearer understanding of your overall financial status through the base currency overview.
