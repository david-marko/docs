### Updating Your Business Sector

Specifying your business sector helps Sarafa understand the nature of your operations and may be used for internal analytics and tailored feature recommendations.

1.  Within the Business Settings, locate the "Sector"
2.  Click on the dropdown menu or the edit option.
3.  Select the business sector that best describes your primary activities from the available options.
4.  Click "Save Changes" to update your selection.

### Setting Your Base Currency

Your **Base Currency** is a crucial setting that provides you with a consolidated overview of your financial balances across your various stablecoin wallets. Sarafa will use the prevailing exchange rates to convert the balances in your USD, KES, UGX, and SSP wallets into your chosen base currency, giving you a single, easily understandable figure for your total holdings.

1.  In the Business Settings, find the "Base Currency" field.
2.  Click on the dropdown menu.
3.  Select your preferred base currency from the available options (e.g., USD, KES, UGX). **Choose the currency in which you primarily want to see your overall financial status.**
4.  Click "Save Changes."

Once you set a base currency, your dashboard and other relevant sections will display your total balance converted into that currency, offering a convenient snapshot of your overall financial position within Sarafa.

### Adding a Business Bio

Your business bio allows you to provide a brief description of your company, its mission, or any other relevant information you want to include in your Sarafa profile. This can be helpful for identification purposes and when interacting with other Sarafa users.

1.  Within the Business Settings, locate the "Bio" or "Description" field.
2.  Click on the text area or the edit option.
3.  Enter your business bio. Keep it concise and informative.
4.  Click "Save Changes" to save your bio.
