## Send Funds

Here's a general guide on how to send funds:

1.  Navigate to the "Send Funds" section in your Sarafa dashboard.

2.  You will typically have options to send to "Mobile Money" or "Bank." Choose the desired method.

### Sending to Mobile Money

1.  Select the wallet you want to send funds from (e.g., KES Wallet).
2.  Choose "Mobile Money" as the recipient type.
3.  You will be prompted to enter the recipient's details:
    * **Recipient's Mobile Network Provider:** Select the correct mobile money service provider (e.g., MTN Mobile Money, Airtel Money).
    * **Recipient's Mobile Money Number:** Enter the recipient's valid mobile money phone number. **Double-check this number for accuracy.**
    * **Amount to Send:** Enter the amount you wish to send in the selected currency.

4.  Review the transaction details, including the recipient's information and the amount to be sent.
5.  Confirm the transaction. You may be required to enter your account password or a verification code to authorize the transfer.

The funds will typically be sent to the recipient's mobile money account within a short period. You will receive a confirmation of the transaction within Sarafa.

### Sending to a Bank Account

1.  Select the wallet you want to send funds from (e.g., USD Wallet).
2.  Choose "Bank" as the recipient type.
3.  You will need to provide the recipient's bank details:
    * **Recipient's Bank Name:** Select the correct bank from the provided list of supported banks in the relevant country.
    * **Recipient's Account Name:** Enter the full name of the bank account holder. **Ensure this matches the name on the bank account exactly.**
    * **Recipient's Bank Account Number:** Enter the recipient's full bank account number. **Verify this number carefully.**
    * **Bank Branch (Optional):** You may be asked for the bank branch name or code.
    * **Swift/BIC Code (for international transfers):** If you are sending to a bank in a different country, you will likely need to provide the bank's Swift/BIC code.
    * **Amount to Send:** Enter the amount you wish to send in the selected currency.
    * **Payment Reference (Optional):** You can add a reference that will appear on the recipient's bank statement.

4.  Carefully review all the recipient's bank details and the amount to be sent. **Incorrect bank details can lead to delays or loss of funds.**
5.  Confirm the transaction. You may be required to enter your account password or a verification code to authorize the transfer.

Bank transfers can take longer to process than mobile money transfers, depending on the banks involved and the destination country. You will receive a confirmation of the transaction within Sarafa, and the recipient should see the funds in their bank account according to their bank's processing times.

**Supported Countries:**

Sarafa currently supports sending funds via mobile money to the following countries:

Please ensure that the recipient's mobile money account or bank account is active and correctly registered in one of these supported countries. You will be guided through the specific requirements and supported providers/banks within the "Send Funds" section of the platform based on the currency you are sending.
