2.  **Include Your Sarafa Account Number as Reference:** In the "Payment Reference," "Description," or "Narrative" field of your bank transfer, **always include your unique Sarafa Account Number (e.g., 901XXXXX)**. This is essential for us to identify your deposit and credit it to your account.

3.  **Send the Correct Currency:** Ensure that the currency of your bank transfer matches the currency of the Sarafa bank account you are sending to (e.g., send USD to the Sarafa USD bank account).
4.  **Keep Proof of Payment:** Retain a copy of your bank transfer receipt or confirmation for your records. You may be asked to provide this in case of any discrepancies.

Once your bank transfer is received and identified (thanks to your Sarafa Account Number in the reference), the corresponding amount will be credited to your Sarafa wallet. Please note that bank transfer processing times may vary depending on your bank and location.
