## Exchange Between Currencies

Sarafa allows you to seamlessly exchange between your different stablecoin wallets (USD, SSP, UGX, KES) directly within the platform. This feature provides you with the flexibility to manage your funds in the currency that best suits your needs at any given time.

Here's how you can exchange between different stablecoins:

1.  Navigate to the "Exchange" or "Swap" section in your Sarafa dashboard.

7.  **Confirm the Exchange:** If you are satisfied with the displayed rate, click the "Exchange," "Swap," or "Convert" button to proceed.
8.  You may be asked to confirm the transaction details before it is finalized.

Once confirmed, the specified amount will be deducted from your source wallet, and the equivalent amount in the target currency will be credited to your destination wallet. You will typically see a record of this exchange in your transaction history.

**Minimum Exchange Amount:** Please note that the current minimum amount for any exchange transaction on Sarafa is the equivalent of **50 USD**. Any exchange request below this threshold will not be processed.

**Important Disclaimer Regarding SSP Exchanges:** Please be aware that for all exchange transactions involving the South Sudanese Pound (SSP), the prevailing **daily parallel market exchange rates** will be applied. These rates may fluctuate and can differ from official exchange rates. By proceeding with an SSP exchange, you acknowledge and agree to the application of these parallel market rates.
