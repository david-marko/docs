## Your Sarafa Account

Upon successful registration, your business is provisioned with a unique **Sarafa Account**, identified by a distinct account number (e.g., `9013292323`). This central account serves as the foundation for managing all your financial activities within the Sarafa platform. Think of it as your primary financial hub within our ecosystem.

A key feature of your Sarafa Account is its support for **multi-currency wallets**. To facilitate seamless transactions and cater to businesses operating across different regions, we provide dedicated wallets for the following stablecoins, pegged to these fiat currencies:

* **USD Wallet:** For transactions and holdings in United States Dollar-pegged stablecoins.

Your Sarafa Account and its associated multi-currency wallets are designed to provide you with the flexibility and efficiency needed to manage your business finances in a globalized marketplace. You can easily navigate between these wallets within your account dashboard to view balances, initiate transactions, and manage your funds.
