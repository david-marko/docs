## Primary Accounts

Primary Accounts serve as your primary channels for quickly depositing funds into your Sarafa wallets and receiving payments from others. By designating certain methods as "primary," you streamline your most frequent transaction flows, making financial management more efficient.

Think of Primary Accounts as your go-to connections for easily moving funds in and out of your Sarafa ecosystem.

### Creating a Primary Account

You can set up Primary Accounts for both mobile money and bank transfers, linking them directly to your Sarafa profile. Here's a general overview of how to add each type:

**Adding a Mobile Money Primary Account:**

1.  Navigate to the "Primary Accounts" or "Payment Methods" section within your Sarafa account settings.

2.  Click on the option to "Add Mobile Money Account" or similar.

3.  You will be prompted to enter the following details:
    * **Mobile Network Provider:** Select your mobile money service provider (e.g., MTN Mobile Money, Airtel Money).
    * **Mobile Money Number:** Enter your registered mobile money phone number.
    * **Account Nickname (Optional):** You can add a nickname for easy identification (e.g., "My Personal Mobile").
4.  Follow any on-screen instructions for verification, which may involve receiving an OTP (One-Time Password) on your mobile device.
5.  Once verified, you can designate this mobile money account as a "Primary" account for deposits and/or withdrawals.

**Adding a Bank Primary Account:**

1.  In the "Primary Accounts" or "Payment Methods" section, click on the option to "Add Bank Account" or similar.
    {/* <Image src="/images/add-bank-account-placeholder.png" alt="Add Bank Account Option" /> */}
2.  You will need to provide the following information:
    * **Bank Name:** Select your bank from the provided list.
    * **Account Holder Name:** Ensure this matches the name on your bank account.
    * **Bank Account Number:** Enter your full bank account number.
    * **Branch Name (Optional):** You may be asked for the bank branch name.
    * **Account Type:** Specify the type of your bank account (e.g., Savings, Current).
    * **Account Nickname (Optional):** Add a nickname for easy recognition (e.g., "Business Checking").
3.  You may need to go through a verification process, which could involve confirming a small test deposit or linking your bank account through a secure third-party service.
4.  After successful verification, you can set this bank account as a "Primary" account for deposits and/or withdrawals.

Once a mobile money or bank account is set as primary, it will often be pre-selected or easily accessible when you initiate deposit or withdrawal requests, saving you time and effort.

### Removing a Primary Account

If you need to remove a Primary Account:

1.  Navigate back to the "Primary Accounts" or "Payment Methods" section in your account settings.
2.  Locate the Primary Account you wish to remove.
3.  You should see an option to "Remove," "Delete," or a similar icon (e.g., a trash can icon) associated with that account.
    {/* <Image src="/images/remove-primary-account-placeholder.png" alt="Remove Primary Account Option" /> */}
4.  Click on the "Remove" option.
5.  You may be asked to confirm your decision. Follow the on-screen prompts to finalize the removal.

After removal, the account will no longer be designated as primary, and you will need to select a different method or re-enter the details for future transactions if needed. You can always add it back as a primary account later if required.
