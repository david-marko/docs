## Primary Accounts

Primary Accounts serve as your primary channels for quickly depositing funds into your Sarafa wallets and receiving payments from others.

### Creating a Primary Account

You can set up Primary Accounts for both mobile money and bank transfers, linking them directly to your Sarafa profile. Here's a general overview of how to add each type:

**Adding a Mobile Money Primary Account:**

1.  Navigate to the "Payments" section within your Sarafa account settings.
2.  Click on the option to "Add Mobile Money Account".

3.  You will be prompted to enter the following details:
    * **Mobile Network Provider:** Select your mobile money service provider (e.g., MTN Mobile Money, Airtel Money).
    * **Mobile Money Number:** Enter your registered mobile money phone number.
    * **Account Nickname (Optional):** You can add a nickname for easy identification (e.g., "My Personal Mobile").
4.  Follow any on-screen instructions for verification, which may involve receiving an OTP (One-Time Password) on your mobile device.
5.  Once verified, you can designate this mobile money account as a "Primary" account for deposits and/or withdrawals.

**Adding a Bank Primary Account:**

1.  In the "Payments" section, click on the option to "Add Bank Account".

2.  You will need to provide the following information:
    * **Bank Name:** Select your bank from the provided list.
    * **Account Holder Name:** Ensure this matches the name on your bank account.
    * **Bank Account Number:** Enter your full bank account number.
    * **Branch Name (Optional):** You may be asked for the bank branch name.

Once a mobile money or bank account is set as primary, it will often be pre-selected or easily accessible when you initiate deposit or withdrawal requests, saving you time and effort.

### Removing a Primary Account

If you need to remove a Primary Account:

1.  Navigate back to the "Payments" section in your account settings.
2.  Locate the Primary Account you wish to remove.
3.  You should see an option to "Remove," "Delete," or a similar icon (e.g., a trash can icon) associated with that account.
4.  Click on the "Remove" option.
5.  You may be asked to confirm your decision. Follow the on-screen prompts to finalize the removal.

After removal, the account will no longer be designated as primary, and you will need to select a different method or re-enter the details for future transactions if needed. You can always add it back as a primary account later if required.
