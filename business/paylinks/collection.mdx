## Collections via Payment Links

Sarafa's Collection feature allows you to generate unique payment links for quick and easy fund collection. These links are ideal for various scenarios where you need to receive payments without sending a formal invoice, such as immediate payments for goods or services, tips, or general contributions.

When you create a Collection link, Sarafa generates a simple yet secure checkout page. Anyone with the link can access this page and send you the specified amount in the designated stablecoin.

### Creating a Collection Link

Generating a Collection link is a straightforward process:

1.  Navigate to the "Collections" or "Payment Links" section in your Sarafa dashboard.
    {/* <Image src="/images/collections-section-placeholder.png" alt="Collections Section" /> */}
2.  Click on "Create New Collection Link" or a similar button.
    {/* <Image src="/images/create-collection-link-placeholder.png" alt="Create New Collection Link Button" /> */}
3.  You will be presented with a form to configure your payment link. The required details typically include:
    * **Title/Description:** A brief description of what the payment is for (e.g., "Payment for Consultation," "Donation"). This will be visible to the payer on the checkout page.
    * **Amount:** The specific amount you are requesting in a chosen stablecoin currency (USD, KES, UGX, SSP). You may have the option to create a link where the payer can enter the amount.
    * **Currency:** Select the stablecoin currency you wish to receive (e.g., USD).
    * **Custom Link (Optional):** Some platforms allow you to customize the end of the payment link for easier sharing and recognition (e.g., `sarafa.ss/pay/yourbusiness`).
    * **Expiration Date (Optional):** You might be able to set an expiry date for the link.
    * **Success Redirect URL (Optional):** You may have the option to redirect payers to a specific URL after successful payment (e.g., your website's thank you page).
    {/* <Image src="/images/create-collection-form-placeholder.png" alt="Create Collection Link Form" /> */}
4.  Once you have filled in the required details, click "Generate Link" or "Create Payment Link."

Sarafa will then generate a unique URL that you can share with those who need to pay you.

### The Checkout Page

When someone clicks on your Collection link, they will be directed to a secure Sarafa-hosted checkout page. This page typically displays:

* **Your Business Name/Identifier:** So the payer knows who they are paying.
* **The Title/Description:** The reason for the payment as you specified.
* **The Amount and Currency:** The amount they are expected to pay.
* **Payment Options:** The available methods for the payer to send funds (e.g., their Sarafa wallet, other integrated payment gateways).

The payer simply chooses their preferred payment method and follows the prompts to complete the transaction.

### Viewing Collection Link Transactions

To track payments received through your Collection links:

1.  Navigate to the "Collections" or "Payment Links" section in your Sarafa dashboard.
2.  You will typically see a list of all the Collection links you have created.
3.  Select the specific Collection link you want to view transactions for.
4.  You should find an option like "View Transactions," "Link Activity," or similar.
    {/* <Image src="/images/view-collection-transactions-placeholder.png" alt="View Collection Transactions Button" /> */}
5.  Clicking this will display a list of all payments made through that particular Collection link.

This transaction history will usually include details such as:

* **Payer Information (if available):** May show the payer's Sarafa username or other identifying information.
* **Transaction ID:** The unique identifier for the payment.
* **Date and Time of Payment:** When the payment was made.
* **Amount Paid:** The amount received.
* **Status:** The status of the payment (e.g., Completed).

By using Collection links, you can efficiently receive payments for various purposes with a simple and shareable link, and easily track all associated transactions within your Sarafa account.
