Sarafa's Invoicing feature empowers you to create and manage professional invoices directly within the platform. This streamlines your billing process, making it easier to request and track payments from your customers.

The primary purpose of the Invoicing tool is to simplify the creation, sending, and management of payment requests. By generating invoices through Sarafa, you can ensure clear communication of payment terms and provide your customers with a convenient way to pay you using local currencies.

### Viewing Your Invoices and Their Statuses

The "Paylinks" section provides a centralized overview of all the invoices you have created. Here, you can:

* **View a list of all your invoices:** See key details such as invoice number, customer name, issue date, due date, and total amount.

* **Issue Date:** The date the invoice is created.
* **Due Date:** The date by which the payment is expected.
* **Currency:** The stablecoin currency in which the invoice is being issued (e.g., USD, KES, UGX, SSP).

* **Notes or Terms (Optional):** You can include any additional notes or payment terms for the customer.
