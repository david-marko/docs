Sarafa's Donations feature provides a dedicated way for individuals and organizations to create and manage donation links for various causes. These links simplify the process of receiving contributions in stablecoins, making it easy for supporters to contribute.

Creating a Donation link generates a user-friendly checkout page specifically designed for accepting donations. This page can be shared across various platforms to reach potential donors.

### Creating a Donation Link

Setting up a Donation link involves providing some key information:

1.  Navigate to the "Donations" section in your Sarafa dashboard.

3.  You will be presented with a form to configure your donation link. The required details typically include:
    * **Campaign Title:** A clear and compelling title for your donation campaign (e.g., "Support Our Education Fund," "Help Provide Clean Water"). This will be prominently displayed on the donation page.
    * **Description:** Provide more details about your cause and how the donations will be used.
    * **Target Amount (Optional):** You can set a specific fundraising goal. This will be displayed on the donation page to motivate donors and track progress.
    * **Currency:** Select the stablecoin currency you wish to receive donations in (USD, KES, UGX, SSP). You can create multiple donation links for different currencies.
    * **Custom Link (Optional):** Personalize the end of your donation link for easier sharing (e.g., `sarafa.ss/donate/yourcause`).
    * **Image/Logo (Optional):** Upload an image or logo to visually represent your campaign.
    * **Thank You Message (Optional):** Customize the message donors will see after making a contribution.

4.  Once you have entered the necessary information, click "Generate Link" or "Create Donation Link."

You will then receive a unique URL that you can share with your supporters.

### Donation Checkout Page

When someone clicks on your Donation link, they will be directed to a dedicated Sarafa donation page. This page typically features:

* **Your Campaign Title and Description:** Clearly outlining the cause.
* **Your Image/Logo (if uploaded):** Enhancing visual appeal and branding.
* **The Target Amount and Progress Bar (if set):** Showing the fundraising goal and how much has been raised.
* **Currency:** Clearly indicating the currency for donations.
* **Amount Input Field:** Allowing donors to enter the amount they wish to contribute.
* **Payment Options:** Providing various methods for donors to send funds (e.g., their Sarafa wallet, other integrated payment gateways).
* **Optional Comments Field:** Enabling donors to leave a message with their contribution.

The checkout process is designed to be simple and secure, encouraging more contributions.

### Multi-Currency Support

Sarafa's Donation links support receiving contributions in USD, KES, UGX, and SSP stablecoins. You can create separate donation links for each currency to cater to a global audience or specific regional preferences. This flexibility ensures that donors can contribute in the currency they are most comfortable with.

### Transparency for Donors

Transparency is crucial for building trust with your donors. Sarafa's Donation feature often includes elements that promote openness:

* **Displaying the Target Amount and Progress:** If you set a fundraising goal, the donation page typically shows the total amount raised so far, encouraging others to contribute and help reach the target.
* **Publicly Listing Contributors (Optional):** You may have the option to display the names (or anonymized identifiers) and contribution amounts of donors who choose to be public. This can create a sense of community and encourage further donations by showing the collective support.
