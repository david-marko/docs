## Application Programming Interface (API)

The Sarafa API provides a powerful and flexible way for your business to integrate its existing systems and workflows directly with the Sarafa platform. This enables seamless automation and unlocks a wide range of possibilities for managing your finances more efficiently.

### Accessing Your API Key

To begin using the Sarafa API, you will need to generate an API key associated with your business account. You can typically find and manage your API keys within the **Settings** or **Developer** section of your Sarafa dashboard.

1.  Log in to your Sarafa Business Account at [https://business.sarafa.ss](https://business.sarafa.ss).
2.  Navigate to the **Settings** or a similarly named section (e.g., "API Keys," "Developer Tools").

3.  Look for an option to "Generate New API Key" or "Create API Key."
4.  Follow the on-screen instructions to create your unique API key. You may be prompted to provide a name or description for the key for your reference.
5.  **Important:** Once generated, treat your API key with the same level of security as your login credentials. Do not share it publicly or embed it directly in client-side code.
