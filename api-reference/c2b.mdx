## Getting Started
To enable C2B payments for your business, you must first be approved by the Sarafa team. The process is straightforward:

1. Ensure you have a registered Sarafa business account.
2. Have a high-quality logo ready for your business.
3. Send an email to care@sarafa.ss with your request.

Upon approval, you will be provided with a unique paybill number which customers can use to make payments to your business.

## C2B Payment Feature Documentation
The Sarafa C2B API is designed for businesses to collect payments from consumers. It operates as a pull-based payment system, where the consumer initiates the transaction, and your system is notified through a series of asynchronous communication steps.

## Requesting a Payment
To configure a C2B payment, you are required to provide two notification URLs. These URLs are essential for the asynchronous communication flow that powers the C2B process.

**verification_url**: This URL receives a request from Sarafa to verify the transaction details before any funds are moved. This is your system's opportunity to validate the account number or paybill number and the transaction amount.

**callback_url**: This URL is where Sarafa will send a confirmation once the payment has been successfully completed.

## Verification Payload
When a consumer initiates a payment, Sarafa will first send a POST request to your designated verification_url. This payload allows you to validate the account_number or paybill_number and ensure the amount is correct for the service or product being purchased.

Example Payload:
```json
{
  "paybill_number": "123123",
  "account_number": "1234567890",
  "amount": 5,
  "currency": "USD"
}
```

### Expected Verification Response
Your API must respond to the verification request with a specific HTTP status code and a JSON payload to indicate whether the transaction should proceed.

200 OK: The transaction is valid, and the payment can be processed. Your response body should contain a status of "success".

Example Response:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Transaction verified and approved."
}
```

400 Bad Request: The transaction details are invalid. Your response body should contain a status of "failed" and a clear message explaining the reason.

Example Response:
```json
{
  "status": "failed",
  "message": "Invalid account/paybill number or incorrect amount."
}
```
Any other HTTP response code will be treated as a failed verification, and Sarafa will not proceed with the payment.

## Callback Payload
After a successful payment, Sarafa will send a POST request to your callback_url to confirm receipt of the funds. This is the final step in the process, allowing your system to update its records with the confirmed payment.

Example Payload:

```json
{
  "transaction_id": "sar-123456789",
  "status": "completed",
  "amount": 50,
  "currency": "USD",
  "paybill_number": "123123",
  "account_number": "1234567890",
  "payment_date": "2025-09-17T11:04:00Z",
  "metadata": {
    "customer_email": "jdoe@gmail.com",
    "customer_name": "John Doe"
  }
}
```

Expected Callback Response
Your API must respond with a 200 OK status code to acknowledge receipt of the callback. This signals to Sarafa that your system has successfully recorded the payment confirmation. Any other response code will be considered a failure to receive the callback, and Sarafa may attempt to resend the notification.
200 OK: Payment confirmation successfully received.
Example Response:
```json
{
  "status": "acknowledged",
  "message": "Payment confirmation received."
}
```
