The Sarafa API (Application Programming Interface) provides a powerful and versatile way for your business to programmatically interact with the Sarafa platform. By leveraging the API, you can seamlessly integrate Sarafa's financial functionalities into your existing applications, workflows, and systems, unlocking new levels of automation and efficiency.
To begin utilizing the Sarafa API, you will need to generate an API key. 
You can find detailed instructions on how to do this in the [API](#api) section of this documentation.
